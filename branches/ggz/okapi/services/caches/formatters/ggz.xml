    <brief>Retrieve GGZ file for newer Garmin devices</brief>
    <issue-id>XXX</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>Produce a GGZ file (which is actually a zip file) with content compatible with newer
        Geocaching-enabled Garmin GPS devices.</p>
        <p><b>Important note:</b> This method is in <b>beta version</b>. It's interface may change
        in a backward-incompatible manner, or it may even be removed.</p>
        <p><b>Important note:</b> We might be increasing required authentication level for
        this method to level 2 or 3. You should be prepared for that. Use the highest authentication
        level you've got. Also, if you want the GPX file to include <b>personal data (like user's notes)</b>,
        you have to use Level 3 Authentication anyway.</p>

    <req name='cache_codes'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of cache codes which you are interested in.
        No more than 50 codes are allowed. (This limit is smaller than usual, because
        we're afraid about the sizes of ZIP files produced.)
        This CAN be an empty string (it will still result in a valid ZIP file).</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
        order of preference in which language will be chosen for GPX entities.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name="location_source" default='default-coords'>
        Same as in the <a href="%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/formatters/gpx#location_source%">
        services/caches/formatters/gpx</a> method.
    </opt>
    <opt name="location_change_prefix" default="#">
        Same as in the <a href="%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/formatters/gpx#location_change_prefix%">
        services/caches/formatters/gpx</a> method.
    </opt>
    <returns>
        <p>A GGZ file. You should copy the file to Garmin's internal memory storage.</p>
    </returns>
