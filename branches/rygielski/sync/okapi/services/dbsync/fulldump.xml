	<desc>
		<p>Download the latest snapshot of OKAPI database. You should call this method
		only once in your lifetime. After installing this snapshot, you should use
		'changelog' method to update your database.</p>
		<p>See "Data replication" section (in the left menu) for more information.</p>
		<p><b>Important:</b> This method may substantially change or might be removed.
		We don't plan on doing this, but we may be forced to (i.e. to prevent abuse).</p>
	</desc>
	<returns>
		<p>Compressed TAR file (GZIP or BZ2 might be used). All <b>part*.json</b> files should
		be processed and saved to your database. File named <b>index.json</b>
		will contain a dictionary. Use the <b>db_revision</b> field of this dictionary
		for your first 'changelog' call.</p>
		<p>You should not assume anything permanent about the structure of this file,
		i.e. the names and sizes of the included files may change in future. If you
		set up everything correctly then you need fulldump only once.</p>
