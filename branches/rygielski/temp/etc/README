OKAPI /etc/ directory.

This directory should be EXCLUDED from all OKAPI deployments. SVN hooks
which deploy OKAPI archived in the Google Code "Download" section DO get
rid of this directory prior the deployment.

If you have this file in your OpenCaching repository, then it means that
OKAPI project was not properly merged with your OpenCaching site.
