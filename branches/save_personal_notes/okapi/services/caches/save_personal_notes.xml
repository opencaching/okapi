        <p>This method allows your users to to change the content of the user's 
        personal note from one value to other value.</p>
        <p>We <b>want</b> you to know the pervious value of the personal note, 
        because feel that your user needs to know what it is exactly that is going 
        to be replaced. Note, that we <b>do not require</b> you to know - the 
        <b>old_value</b> parameter is optional. However, if you don't provide it 
        (or provide an obsolete value), then your <b>new_value</b> will be appended 
        to the current personal note instead of replacing it.</p>
        <p>Current personal user notes of a geocache can be retrieved with
        <a href="%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/geocache#fields%">services/caches/geocache</a>
        method, with <b>my_notes</b> passed in <b>fields</b> parameter.</p>
