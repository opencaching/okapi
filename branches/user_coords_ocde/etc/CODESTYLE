Brief OKAPI coding style guide
==============================

PHP:

- Indent with 4 spaces, no tabs.

- Classes: CamelCase, "{" in new line.
- Methods: lowercase_with_underlines, "{" in new line.
- Small codeblocks within methods: "{" in *the same* line (with a space before
  it). Very large blocks: "{" in a new line.
- When using parenetheses and the content doesn't fit in one line, start
  a new line just after "(" and indent 4 spaces (e.g.
  http://i.imgur.com/FZmyD7B.png).
  
- Try to keep <=79 characters in line (not a strict rule, but always <=99).

- Comments:
  - Use "#" or "/* .. */", avoid "//". Use "/** .. */" for docstrings.
  - When commenting within a longer block of code, put a blank line before
    and after the comment.

- Strings:
  - use '' for single word contants lower-case contants (i.e. parameter names,
    field names), e.g. 'cache_code', $cache['type'], etc.
  - use "" for all other strings (especially multiline strings).

- SQL:
  - use multiline strings in SQL queries (the "" strings),
  - use '' for strings within the query (e.g. ...where type in ('1', '2')...),
  - lower-case keywords (select, not SELECT),
  - avoid "`" (use only when necessary),
  - always indent with 4 spaces (same way as in the rest of code),
  - indent "select", "from", "where", "group by" and "order by" sections,
    but only when they contain more than one entry within.
  - when using "left join" with "on", indent the "on" conditions ("on" falls
    into the indent too).
