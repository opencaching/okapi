    <brief>Get information on available geocache properties</brief>
    <issue-id>568</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>Returns information on available geocache properties at this
        OKAPI installation.</p>
        
        <p>You may need this method when
        <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>editing</a> geocache
        listings and when searching for caches by type. In all other
        cases, you don't need to know about differences between OKAPI
        installations. But still this method may help to improve usability
        of your app, e.g. by hiding unnecessary search options.</p>
    </desc>
    <opt name='fields' default='types|sizes|statuses|has_ratings'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of field names which you are interested in.
        Selected fields will be included in the response. See below for the
        list of available fields.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
        order of preference in which language will be chosen for the names in
        fields <b>languages</b> and <b>countries</b>. Note that this option is
        <i>ignored</i> for the <b>regions</b> field, which will always return
        names in local language.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='cache_type'>
        <p>One of the cache type indentifiers returned in the <b>types</b>
        field by an earlier call to this method. If supplied, the
        <b>sizes</b> and <b>password_max_length</b> return values will
        reflect the capabilities for this type of cache.</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the fields you have selected. Currently available fields:</p>

                <p><b>types</b> - list of the cache types which are currently
                available at this installation. See the

                <p><b>sizes</b> - list of the  cache sizes which are currently
                available at this installation [for the given <b>cache_type</b>].
                Note that the returned identifiers correspond the <b>size2</b>
                field of <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/geocache%'>services/caches/geocache</a>,
                not the deprecated <span class='deprecated'><b>size</b></span> field.</p>

                <p><b>statuses</b> - list of the cache statuses which are

            <li>
                <p><b>has_ratings</b> - boolean, <b>true</b> if this installation
                can store geocache quality ratings. Use the
                <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/logs/capabilities%'>services/logs/capabilities</a>
                method to find out if a given geocache can be rated.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>primary_languages</b> - a list of codes of the preferred or
                mostly used languages at this OC site, ordered descending by
                relevance.  You may suggest this set of languages first when your
                user edits cache descriptions (we recommend to present them in
                alphabetical order).</p>

                <p><b>countries</b> - a dictionary (country code => name) of

                that are primarily served by this installation, ordered
                descending by relevance. You may suggest this set of countries

                countries, each containing a dictionary (region code => name)
                of regions that can be assigned to geocache listings. If
                <b>can_set_region</b> is <b>false</b>, then the return value
                currently is <b>null</b>, but this may change. Also, the
                length of the codes (which currently is always 4 characters)
                may change.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>can_set_region</b> - boolean, <b>true</b> if
                <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>services/caches/edit</a>
                will accept the <b>region</b> parameter. If <b>false</b>,
                then this installation will automatically calculate regions
                from the cache location.</p>

                <p><b>password_max_length</b> - the maximum length of
                a password that will be accepted by
                <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>services/caches/edit</a>
                [for the given <b>cache_type</b>]. The value <b>0</b> indicates
