    <brief>Query Cache Lists</brief>

    <desc>
        <p>This method is used to query the metadata of all user owned cache lists.
        Such a query ist typically performed by a client application that wants to render
        a list of geocache lists at the UI. The metadata of the list is necessary and sufficient
        for this purpose. Please note, an <i>id</i> is also part of the returned meta data.
        Using this id as a reference code, specific operations can be performed on selected lists
        for instance adding geocaches to the list, removing them, updating the metadata of the
        referenced list or deleting the referenced list entirely. Typically such entities as
        geocaches, logs, or lists, are referenced by a <i>referenceCode</i>, for instance
        for geocaches, there would be a <i>cache_code</i> in the namespace <i>OCxxxxx</i> where
        cache_code would be interpreted as a <i>referenceCode</i> for geocaches. Unfortunately lists
        do not yet have such a <i>referenceCode</i>. They can be referenced only by their internal id,
        which is named <i>id</i> in the returned objects for this method. This id is used as the
        <i>list_id</i> parameter in all subsequent methods dealing with lists.
