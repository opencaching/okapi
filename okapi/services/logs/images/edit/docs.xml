    <brief>Edit an existing log entry image</brief>
    <issue-id>396</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>This method allows you to change properties of an existing log entry
        image. If you need to change the image itself, then you'll need to
        delete it and re-add it.</p>

        <p>At least one of the three parameters <b>caption</b>,
        <b>is_spoiler</b> and <b>position</b> must be supplied.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='image_uuid'>
        <p>ID of the log entry image to be edited. The user of your Access
        Token must be the author of the associated log entry.</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='caption'>
        <p>Plain-text string, a new caption for the image.</p>

        <p>Please note that providing an empty value indicates that your user
        would like to remove the caption, which will often not be allowed
        (then <b>success</b> will be <b>false</b>).</p>

        <p>Note: Some OC sites support only BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) Unicode
        characters on some database fields. If you submit characters from outside of
        the BMP plane (known as "supplementary planes", they include characters such
        as smiley symbols), then keep in mind that your text might be saved garbled.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='is_spoiler'>
        <p>One of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>true</b> - marks the image as spoiler, which means that
                it contains hints for finding the geocache.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>false</b> - marks the image as non-spoiler.
            </li>
         </ul>
    </opt>
    <opt name='position' infotags="ocde-specific">
        <p>If given, it indicates the wanted position of this image on the log
        entry's list of images (do not supply this parameter if you do not want
        to change the order). This parameter takes the same 0-based value as
        described in the <b>add</b> method.</p>

        <p>Please note, that only OCDE-based Opencaching installations allow
        for the order of log images to be changed. OCPL-based installations
        will ignore this parameter (you can check the <b>position</b> field in
        the response to verify if the order has actually been changed or
        not).</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
        order of preference in which language will be chosen for error messages.</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>success</b> - <b>true</b>, if the image was edited successfully,</li>
            <li>
                <b>message</b> - plain-text string, a message for the user,
                which acknowledges success or describes an error (usually you
                want to display this only when <b>success</b> is <b>false</b>),
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>position</b>:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you have supplied the <b>position</b> parameter, then this field
                    will contain a 0-based position of the image on the log entry's list
                    of images - the position which was actually saved (it may differ from
                    the position you have requested).</li>

                    <li>If you have not supplied the <b>position</b> parameter, it will
                    contain <b>null</b>.</li>

                    <li>In case of an error, it will also contain <b>null</b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
