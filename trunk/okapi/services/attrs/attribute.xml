		<p>Retrieve data on a single OKAPI geocache-attribute.</p>
		
		<p>OKAPI attributes are identified by an unique ID called an <b>A-code</b>.
		All OKAPI attributes are shared among all OKAPI servers. Once an attribute is
		published (e.g. via the <b>attribute_index</b> method), it won't
		disappear, nor will its meaning change. Some attributes may get
		deprecated in the future, but they will remain accessible
		by their original A-code.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='acode'>
		The A-code of the attribute you're interested in.
	</req>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of ISO 639-1 language codes. This indicates the
		order of preference in which language will be chosen for fields like
		<b>name</b> and <b>description</b>.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='fields' default='name'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of field names which you are interested with.
		See the <b>returns</b> section for the list of available fields.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='forward_compatible' default='true'>
		By default, OKAPI will return an empty placeholder if you ask for an
		unknown attribute. If you'd like to catch such errors and handle them
		differently, then you may change this behavior by setting this parameter
		to <b>false</b>. Then, OKAPI will return HTTP 400 error response,
		instead of the placeholder (note that it behaves differently in the
		<b>attributes</b> method).
	</opt>

	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary of fields you have selected in the <b>fields</b>
		parameter. Available fields:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>acode</b> - string, the A-code. Unique identifier of the
				attribute.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>name</b> - plaintext string, name of the attribute (language is
				selected based on your <b>langpref</b> parameter),
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>names</b> - a dictionary of all known names of the attribute, in
				various langauges (ISO 639-1 language code is used as dictionary
				key).</p>
			
				<p>If you'd like to help with the translations, see
				<a href='https://code.google.com/p/opencaching-api/source/browse/trunk/okapi/services/attrs/attribute-definitions.xml'>here</a>.</p>

			<li>
				<p><b>gc_equivs</b> - a list of Geocaching.com (Groundspeak)
				attributes, which have an exact (or very similar) meaning. Each
				attribute is described as a dictionary of the following structure:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>id</b> - ID of the Geocaching.com attribute,</li>
					<li>
						<b>inc</b> - integer, either 1 or 0. See Geocaching.com's
						XSD for details on its meaning,
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>name</b> - the name of the attribute (as it is included
						in Geocaching.com GPX files).
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Note, that one gc_equivs list may have multiple items on it, and
				that one Geocaching.com ID may be present in many gc_equivs.</p>
			</li>
