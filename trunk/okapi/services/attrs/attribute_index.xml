	<brief>Get the list of all OKAPI attributes (A-codes)</brief>
	<issue-id>270</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>This method return <b>all</b> currently defined OKAPI geocache-attributes.
		Useful when you want to cache the data on the client-side.</p>
		
		<p>Keep in mind, that the number of attributes will grow. If your application
		uses multiple OKAPI servers, then you should use one of the frequently
		updated servers for pre-caching attribute data (currently, Opencaching.PL
		is the most frequently updated installation). Also, you should never assume
		that you have the complete list (why, a new attribute might got created just
		as you were reading this!).</p>
		
		<p>Once an attribute is published via this method, it won't disappear, nor
		will its meaning change. It may get deprecated though.</p>
	</desc>
	<opt name='langpref' default='en'>
		Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
	</opt>
	<opt name='fields' default='name'>
		Works the same as in the <b>attribute</b> method.
	</opt>
	<opt name='include_deprecated' default='true'>
		Deprecated attributes are not used by the newest versions of OKAPI,
		but they can still appear in some contexts, i.e. within the data you have
		downloaded prior their deprecation. That's why, by default, all attributes
		are returned, including the deprecated ones. You may skip the deprecated
		attributes by passing <b>false</b> to this parameter.
	</opt>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		A dictionary. A-codes you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys, and
		each value will be an object, as described in the <b>attribute</b> method.
