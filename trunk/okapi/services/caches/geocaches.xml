	<issue-id>20</issue-id>
	<desc>
		<p>This method works like the services/caches/geocache method, but works
		with multiple geocaches (instead of only one).</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='cache_wpts'>
		<p>Pipe-separated list of cache waypoint codes. These represent the
		geocaches you are interested in. No more than 500 codes are allowed.</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='fields' default='wpt|name|location|type|status'>
		<p>Same as in the services/caches/geocache method. Pipe-separated list
		of field names which you are interested with.
		See services/caches/geocache method for a list available values.</p>
	</opt>
	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary. Cache codes you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
		and each value will be a dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>
		<p>For example, for <i>geocaches?cache_wpts=OP3D96|OC124&amp;fields=type</i>
		query, the result might look something link this:</p>
		<pre>{"OP3D96": {"type": "traditional"}, "OC124": null}</pre>
		<p>Value of <b>null</b> means that the given cache haven't been found.
		(This behavior is different than in the services/caches/geocache method, which
		responds with a HTTP 400 error in such case.)</p>
	</returns>
