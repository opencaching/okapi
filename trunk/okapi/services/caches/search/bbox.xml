	<brief>Search for caches within specified bounding box</brief>
	<desc>
		<p>This method is similar to the search/all method, but the results
		are restricted to the caches situated within a given bounding box
		(a rectangle on the map).</p>
		<p>Results are sorted by the distance from the center of the bounding
		box. This also means, that if you hit the limit of geocaches
		returned, you will receive the ones that are in the middle of your
		box, and miss the ones on the edges.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='bbox'>
		<p>The bounding box within to search for caches. The box is defined
		by a string in "<b>S|W|N|E</b>" format, where:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>S</b> stands for southern edge latitude of the box,</li>
			<li><b>W</b> stands for western edge longitude of the box,</li>
			<li><b>N</b> stands for northern edge latitude of the box,</li>
			<li><b>E</b> stands for eastern edge longitude of the box.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Use positive numbers for latitudes in the northern hemisphere and
		longitudes in the eastern hemisphere (and negative for southern and
		western hemispheres accordingly). These are full degrees with a dot
		as a decimal point (ex. "48.7|15.8|54|24.9").</p>
	</req>
	<other-params>
		You may also use all the "stadard filtering" arguments defined
		in the search/all method.
	</other-params>

	<returns>
		<p>Same format as in the search/all method.</p>
