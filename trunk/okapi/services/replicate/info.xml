	<common-format-params/>
	<returns>
		<p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>changelog</b> - a dictionary of the following structure:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>min_revision</b> - the lowest allowed value for the <b>since</b> attribute
					(the ID of the earliest changelog entry kept in our database),</li>
					<li><b>max_revision</b> - the current revision of the database (the ID of the
					newest changelog entry kept in our database),</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>latest_fulldump</b> - a dictionary of the following structure:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>filename</b> - name of the fulldump file (ex. "okapi-dump-r14054.tar.gz"),</li>
					<li><b>revision</b> - revision of the database saved in the latest fulldump,</li>
					<li><b>generated_at</b> - date and time (ISO 8601) when the fulldump was generated,</li>
					<li><b>size</b> - size of the file, in bytes,</li>
					<li><b>size_uncompressed</b> - approximate size of the uncompressed contents, in bytes.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The response MAY contain changes recorded before the revision which you stated in your <b>since</b>
		parameter. This is due to caching. I we already have a response ready, that was produced for a
		"since" parameter which was a little more in the past, we may want to return this cached copy,
		instead of producing a new one. It will be faster for us, and you shouldn't even notice. We will
		still make sure to set the <b>revision</b> and <b>more</b> attributes in a correct way, which
		in turn will make you query us again, if you need to.</p>
